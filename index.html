    <h1>
      Welcome to the Rinny project's homepage!
    </h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Rinny (not to be confused with the project's namesake) is an Unblocked "OS" meant to run in a browser. I mean, if you call Windows 3.X an OS, this is also an OS</p>

    <h1>Featureset:</h1>
    <h2>Separate User configurations</h2>
    <h3>BUC (Basic User Configuration)</h3>
    <p>This will be the entire "OS" in one file. System files and default themes are in one HTML document. Its featureset is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Exportable user configurations. NetApps are stored as cookies, but you can download a JSON file containing user information.</li>
      <li>Portability. One (or two) files to move around.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>PUC (Power User Configuration)</h3>
    <p>This will be the intended experience, meant for those who seek control and customizability. This version will feature:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Actual directory structure</li>
      <li>Advanced themes (Custom CSS)</li>
      <li>Debug console (in case Inspect Element is blocked)</li>
      <li>Kernel Plugins</li>
      <li>Non-NetApp Programs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Clockwork development has been abandoned. This is for those who seek a clockwork-like experience.</li>
      <li>Clockwork also hasn't had much in the name of alternatives.</li>
      <li>My previous attempts weren't all that successful due to scope creep, not knowing as much, and lack of organization. Now with those remedied, this should actually develop.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Where do I download this?</h2>
    <p>This project is in early stages of development, and thus, isn't usable in its current state. If you <i>really</i> want to download it, go to the <a href="https://github.com/moonlight-network/Rinny">GitHub page</a>, click "Code." and click "Download ZIP." </p>
