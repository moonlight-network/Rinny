# Rinny "Unblocked OS" plans

## Configurations

### Power User Configuration (PUC)

intended to be run from a flash drive, the file structure is as follows:
> `/programs/`(Program ID, 8 characters long, alphanumeric, case-sensitive)/(Program Files)

> `/kernel/`(critical system files, default settings, system programs)

> `/themes/`(theme ID, same format as Program ID)/(Theme Assets, CSS and Image files)

> `/colorpal/`(color palette files for basic themes, similar to the Classic Windows theme. These will be JSON files with `.pal` extension)

> `index.html` <--- Bootloader 

> Root folder is to be named "Rinny"

### Basic User Configuration (BUC) 

> intended to be downloaded and shared

> `rinny.html` will be the entire Rinny "OS" itself, containing built-in programs. 

> Cookies store your settings. Your settings can be downloaded as a JSON file with a .cnf extension at any time. This is useful if you want to carry your settings over.

Look and feel: Mimic that of Classic Windows (95 to 2000/ME) with a Whistler (XP Beta)-like login manager/screen locker


### Codenames.

Rinny is a codename, and it comes from Pretty Blood (as is with codenames for future versions.) Because of this, the Rinny branding will be temporary.

#### Future OS codenames:

> 1.X: Rinny

> 2.X: Luny

> 3.X: Bloon

> 4.X: Batric

> 5.X: Sadny

> 6.X: Ron

> Unstable/Preview: Elma

#### Program Codenames

These are to be named after the Ascii Art cats (and other AA characters) from 2channel. These will not be named after Pretty Blood characters to avoid confusion.

> Shell/GUI: Shii

> Userland: Giko

> Browser: Mona

> Media Player: Morara

### Featureset

> Classic Windows-like taskbar and Programs menu

> No fancy animations (by default)

> The ability to choose between full-screen or windowed applications.

> A modified version of Unblocked Games from NXX99 as an example program for PUC

> NetQuake as another example PUC example. To avoid ID Software killing me, only the freeware version can be used unless you manually add PAK1 to the program's id1 directory

> Easy to use theme manager.

> Legacy PUC and BUC

### Logo

Until I come up with a reasonable design, I'll use a modified version of the Windows 3.1 Beta logo with Rinny's face in it.
